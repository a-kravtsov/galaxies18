    "### Model Tully-Fisher and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Observed galaxies exhibit several tight relations between their different observed properties. Such relations are often referred to as *scaling relations* because they describe how one galaxy property \"scales\" as a function of another property. Such tight relations are of paramount importance because they inform us about regularities during galaxy formation and connections between physical processes that affect different properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous scaling relations is the *Tully-Fisher relation* (TFR) between galaxy rotation velocity and its luminosity (<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977A%26A....54..661T\">Tully & Fisher 1977</a>). A related relation is the *baryonic Tully-Fisher relation* (BTFR) between rotation velocity and \"baryon mass\" (gas+star mass), which was first considered by <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...632..859M\">McGaugh (2005)</a>.\n",
    "This relation is extensively used in a variety of areas, including 1) distance measurements to galaxies, 2) constraints on galaxy formation models, 3) constraints on alternative gravity models, 4) constraints on the mass-to-light ratios and initial mass function of stars in galaxies, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini-project description\n",
    "For galaxy model with all the included processes, construct the BTFR - i.e., the correlation of $M_{\\rm g}+M_*$ and $V_{\\rm 2.2}$, where $V_{\\rm 2.2}$ is the rotation velocity at the $R_{\\rm out}=2.2R_{\\rm d}$. The radius $2.2R_{\\rm d}$ can be computed using Mo et al. 1998 model that is already implemented (with adjustments to fit observed galaxies from HW5). The rotation velocity at $R_{\\rm out}=2.2R_{\\rm d}$ can be computed as a sum of contributions of baryons in the disk and dark matter in a spherical halo (see, e.g., S 11.1.2 in the Mo, van den Bosch & White book):\n",

    "where $I_n$ and $K_n$ are the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively, $R_d$ is the disk scale length,  and $y=R/(2R_d)$. Recall that total mass of the exponential disk is $M_d=2\\pi\\Sigma_0 R_d^2$. Halo circular profile is \n",

    "#### Background\n",
    "Observed galaxies exhibit a strong correlation between star formation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity, which some astronomers have dubbled \"the fundamental relation\" (see <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.408.2115M\">Mannucci et al. 2010</a>).  \n",

    "Projection of this relation onto $M_\\star-Z/Z_\\odot$ plane is also frequently considered and reveals that metallicity of galaxy ISM gas or their stars and galaxy stellar mass are correlated. This correlation extends down to the smallest dwarf galaxies known. \n",

    "### 3. Galactic outflows and effective yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "A useful concept, which emerges from simple chemical evolution models, is the *effective yield*, $y_{\\rm eff}$. It is defined as $y_{\\rm eff}=Z/\\ln(1/f_{\\rm gas})$, where $Z$ is the mass fraction of heavy elements  in the gas and $f_{\\rm gas}\\equiv M_{\\rm gas}/(M_{\\rm gas}+M_*)$ is the gas mass fraction in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, if galaxy was a closed system, the effective yield would be driven to the true heavy element yield of a stellar population, $y_Z$ (<tt>y_Z</tt> in the galaxy model; for a Chabrier IMF it is $y_{\\rm Z}\\approx 0.07$), as the gas metallicity as a function of time in such model can be solved for analytically: $Z(t)=y_Z\\,\\ln(1/f_{\\rm gas})$. Thus, the difference of the ratio $Z_{\\rm gas}/\\ln(1/f_{\\rm gas})$ from the true expected yield, $y_Z$, for a real system indicates how far the system deviates from \"closed box\". For example, in the presence of outflows, yield would be lower than the true yield. Thus, $y_{\\rm eff}$ is a diagnostics that outflows operate in galaxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini-project tasks description:\n",
    "<b>(a)</b> Plot $y_{\\rm eff}$ as a function of $M_\\star$ for model without outflows, for model with outflows but constant mass loading factor $\\eta$, and with mass-dependent outflow metallicity of Muratov et al. (2015) or something close. How does effective yield of galaxies change in these models?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(b)</b> Estimate the fraction of metals retained within stars and gas of the galaxy.

(2014)</a>. How do you interpret the results in terms of the galaxy formation processes?"

    "### 4. Metallicity distribution of stars in Milky Way-sized systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "When people compared simpler chemical evolution models - i.e., without modeling cosmological mass accretion and star formation explicitly - to observed distribution of metallicities of stars in the Milky Way disk, they identified what's known as the *G-dwarf problem* (<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1962AJ.....67..486V\">van den Bergh 1962</a>) - or dearth of low-metallicity stars in the Milky Way disk compared to  the prediction of the \"closed box\" chemical evolution model, in which there are no inflows or outflows of gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to state the problem is that observed *distribution of metallicities of low-mass stars in the Milky Way disk is too peaked near solar metallicity.* \n",
    "\n",
    "It has now been shown that <a href=\"http://astrobites.org/2012/02/15/and-now-theres-a-problem-with-m-dwarfs-too/\">similar problem exists for K- and M-dwarfs</a>, which are longer lived stars so probe earlier stages of enrichment. The \"problem\" also exist in other galaxies (e.g., <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1996AJ....112..948W\">Worthey et al. 1996</a>). \n",

    "In modelling galaxy spectra and colors a critical role is played by the assumption about functional form of the galaxy star formation history (SFH). Historically, people have often used exponentially decaying SFHs.
